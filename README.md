Fibonacci Sequence in C
This program calculates and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms. It allows the user to input the number of terms they want to generate and then displays the corresponding Fibonacci sequence.

Key Features:
The user is prompted to enter how many terms of the Fibonacci sequence they want to generate.
The program calculates each term of the Fibonacci sequence based on the following rule:
Fib(0) = 0
Fib(1) = 1
Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2) for n > 1
The sequence is printed in order, with each number separated by a space.
The program handles any valid number of terms greater than zero and ensures the correct number of terms is generated.
How it Works:
The user enters a number n, which specifies how many terms of the Fibonacci sequence to generate.
The program initializes the first two terms: 0 and 1.
Then, using a loop, the program calculates the next terms by adding the two previous terms together.
The calculated sequence is printed to the console.
This Fibonacci calculator in C is simple and efficient, generating the sequence with minimal input and output.
